I try to find you in all the fairytales that I read
I want that perfect kiss from that famous movie scene
If I could break the walls between my reality and my dream
Every day I would wake up to see you smiling back at me...
I got my thigh-highs on, feel like Wonder Woman
That’s when you want all in, but I’m not your woman
